Okay, let me see. The question is asking for the difference in value between Magenta and Web Purple based on the bar chart described. 

First, I need to recall the details given about each bar. The Magenta bar goes up to 65 on the x-axis, and the Web Purple bar reaches 50. So, the x-axis is the value here, right? The y-axis is the categories, so the x-axis values are the actual numbers. 

To find the difference, I subtract the smaller value from the larger one. So that would be 65 minus 50. Let me do that calculation: 65 - 50 equals 15.
</think>

The Magenta bar reaches 65 on the x-axis, while the Web Purple bar reaches 50. The difference is calculated by subtracting the smaller value from the larger one: 65 âˆ’ 50 = 15.
